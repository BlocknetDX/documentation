## Centralized Exchanges
Centralized exchanges are one of the most popular ways to trade cryptocurrency. Some serve different markets, some are in direct competition, some have cheaper fees, and some are subject to more or less strict regulatory requirements. They are operated by a single company, which may be obliged by the laws of the jurisdiction in which it operates to collect data on its customers.The following options are available:
