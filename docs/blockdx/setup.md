## Setup
1. Install the Blocknet wallet. The Blocknet wallet is required to
   facilitate peer-to-peer trading on Block DX.

1. Since Block DX is non-custodial, you'll need to store the
   [digital assets](/resources/glossary/#digital-asset) you want to
   trade in your own wallet. One convenient option is to store them in your own [XLite wallet](https://xlitewallet.com), a
   noncustodial, lightweight, decentralized, multi-asset wallet
   powered by Blocknet. But if XLite doesn't support the assets you
   want to trade, or if you simply prefer not to use XLite for some
   assets, then you'll
   need to install the native wallets of those assets.
    * Note: These native wallets are the native Qt/cli wallets released by each asset's respective project, which you may already have installed. Block DX does not generate wallets for you.
