title: Blocknet Wallet Setup Guide
description: This guide explains how to setup your Blocknet wallet to securely store your BLOCK including installation, syncing, encryption, and staking.


# Getting Started
The Blocknet wallet allows you to securely manage your [BLOCK](/blockchain/introduction). It's important to manage your funds through a wallet you own. In your wallet there is something called private keys. Think of private keys like a bank account. When you have funds in your wallet, they are in an "account" that you own and control.

??? question "Why shouldn't I store my funds on an exchange?"
	While you can store your funds on an exchange, it is risky to do so since you don't really own the wallet your funds are stored in. In other words, when you use an exchange, your funds are really in the exchanges "account" and they are just allowing you access.

	These exchanges are highly unregulated, which can lead to issues. They have the ability to freeze withdrawals of funds, and while the exchange owners can tell users that their funds are safe, there is no way to guarantee this given the lack of rules and a regulating body.

	Due to the large number of funds being stored on exchanges, it becomes a target for hackers. There is a huge risk storing funds on an exchange with [$1.7 billion stolen from exchanges in 2018](https://blockonomi.com/bitcoin-theft-skyrocketed-2-billion/) alone.
