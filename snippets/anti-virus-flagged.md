!!! info "Note: Antivirus software may be flagged"
	It is normal for antivirus software to flag the wallet as potentially dangerous. This is a common issue with most wallets, including Bitcoin's. As long as the wallet was downloaded from [https://blocknet.co](https://blocknet.co), [https://xlitewallet.com](https://xlitewallet.com), [Blocknet's Github](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blocknet/releases) or [Blocknet's XLite Github](https://github.com/blocknetdx/xlite/releases), it can be deemed as safe and the warning can be ignored. You may need to temporarily disable antivirus download protection to complete the download.
