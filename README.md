# Blocknet Documentation
This repository contains the source code for Blocknet's [documentation portal website](https://docs.blocknet.co). These documents are currently under progressive and iterative development.

> Powered by [MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/) and [MkDocs Material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material).


## Contributing
Follow the Getting Started instructions below to get your local environment setup, create a branch off `doc-portal` with your updates following the guidelines below, and create a PR to `doc-portal`. 

If you're not familiar enough with for how to do this, feel free to create a [Github issue](https://github.com/blocknetdx/documentation/issues/new) with corrections, edits, or additions. If you have a lot of content to add, the best method would be to enter the content into a Google Doc (with settings set to public comments allowed) and link that in your Github issue.


## Getting Started
MkDocs supports Python versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and pypy.

Using Linux or MacOS:

```shell
# clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/blocknetdx/documentation.git

# update pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# install mkdocs and mkdocs-material
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-material

# install required extensions
pip install markdown
pip install fontawesome-markdown
pip install pygments
pip install pymdown-extensions
```

Run dev server:

```
# use from within /documentation/
mkdocs serve
```

This will compile the docs and output the localhost address where the changes can be previewed:

```
$ mkdocs serve
INFO    -  Building documentation...
INFO    -  Cleaning site directory
[I 160402 15:50:43 server:271] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000
[I 160402 15:50:43 handlers:58] Start watching changes
[I 160402 15:50:43 handlers:60] Start detecting changes
```

You can now see the docs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. This will reload automatically when changes are saved. Note that the address is not always the same so it's best to check the output for the correct address.

## Adding Pages

1. Create a markdown file (`.md`) within one of the directories in the `docs/` folder.
1. Add a `title:` and `description:` at the top of the file.
1. Add an `--8<-- "extras.md"` tag at the end of the file.
1. Add a link to the menu (if needed) by listing it under `nav:` in `mkdocs.yml`.
1. Preview the page to make sure everything is rendering correctly.




## Creating and Using Snippets

1. Create a markdown file (`.md`) within the `snippets/` directory.
1. Use `--8<-- "snippetfilename.md"` tag to embed the snippet in a page.
	* The filenames are relative to the `snippets/` directory.
1. Preview the page to make sure everything is rendering correctly.




## Publishing

1. Build the docs with the `mkdocs build` command.
1. In the `site/` directory, remove any folders and subfolders that begin with `-`. This prefix is manually used to flag pages that have not been completed yet.
1. Deploy `site/` contents to staging site for testing.
1. Deploy `site/` contents to [https://docs.blocknet.co/](https://docs.blocknet.co/).
